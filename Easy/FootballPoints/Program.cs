/* Football Points
Create a function that takes the number of wins, draws and losses and calculates the number
of points a football team has obtained so far.

wins get 3 points
draws get 1 point
losses get 0 points

Examples:

FootballPoints(3, 4, 2) ➞ 13

FootballPoints(5, 0, 2) ➞ 15

FootballPoints(0, 0, 1) ➞ 0
